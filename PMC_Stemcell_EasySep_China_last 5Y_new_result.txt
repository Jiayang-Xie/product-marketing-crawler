The abovementioned solutions were mixed in 1.5-ml Protein LoBind tubes, placed on a rotameter, and reacted overnight at 4°C. After the reaction, the mixed solution was magnetically separated and the supernatant was collected for measurement using the Nanodrop. The remaining magnetic bead conjugates were washed three times with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T buffer), and then DNA-2C6 conjugates (1:100 dilution in 10 mM PBS) were added, followed by rotation at room temperature for 1 hour. The precipitate was magnetically separated and washed three times with PBS-T buffer. Next, 20 μl of elution buffer was added to the bead precipitate, followed by incubated at room temperature for 10 min. This mixture was subjected to magnetic separation using EasySep Magnet. The supernatant was collected into a new Eppendorf tube, and 1 μl of neutralization buffer was added immediately to adjust the pH of the eluted product to neutral (pH = 7.0) for subsequent real-time PCR experiments. Real-time PCR was performed in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) programmed at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 30 s. The software calculates the Ct, which indicates the first PCR cycle at which the reported signal exceeds the user-determined baseline signal. On the basis of the data obtained for each experiment, the threshold level was determined to be above the background signal of empty wells and set during the linear increase phase of the signal. Here, the threshold value was set to 10 ΔRn.', 'Blood samples of patients with AD and normal individuals were provided by Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medicine College, China. This clinical study was approved by the Ethics Committee and the Institutional Review Board of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (UHCT22144). All participants provided informed consent for the use of their blood samples for the study. A rapid and efficient method for extracting exosomes from blood samples was proposed. The basic principle included the use biotinylated anti-human CD63 antibodies to capture blood exosomes, followed by the use of antibiotin superparamagnetic nanobeads to separate the captured exosomes. The detailed steps are as follows: An appropriate amount of clinical blood (200 μl) was taken into a test tube, and the blood samples were diluted with PBS (1:1 volume ratio) and kept on ice. Next, 0.5 μl of biotinylated anti-human CD63 antibody was added to the diluted blood samples. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, 10 μl of antibiotin superparamagnetic nanobeads were added to the samples, followed by mixing and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Then, a PBS buffer was added to make the final volume 2 ml. After mixing the abovementioned mixture, the test tube containing the hybrid solution was placed between EasySep Magnet at room temperature for 5 min. The tube containing bound exosomes (Beads@CD63', ' exosomes) was removed from EasySep Magnet and washed three times with 1 ml of PBS buffer. Last, 200 μl of PBS buffer was aspirated to wash the exosomes from the tube wall. The exosomes were resuspended in PBS and stored at 4°C until further use.', ' for 2 hours at 4°C in a TYPE 70 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The enriched exosomes were resuspended in PBS. Each sample was mixed with 200 μl of 3% BSA and incubated with biotin anti-human NCAM antibody (100 μg/ml) on ice for 1 hour. Then, 20 μl of antibiotin superparamagnetic nanobeads containing 200 μl of 3% BSA were added. Next, this mixing solution was placed between EasySep Magnet at room temperature for 5 min. The tube containing bound exosomes (Beads@NCAM', ' exosomes) was removed from EasySep Magnet and washed three times with PBS buffer.

The collected clinical blood exosomes (Beads@exosomes) and the DNA-antibody conjugates were mixed and allowed to react for 1 hour. Following this, 1.5 ml of PBS buffer was added to the mixed reaction solution. After mixing the solution evenly, it was placed between EasySep Magnet and left at room temperature for 5 min.
